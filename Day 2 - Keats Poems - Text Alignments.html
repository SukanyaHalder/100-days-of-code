Ever let the Fancy roam,<br />
Pleasure never is at home:<br />
At a touch sweet Pleasure melteth,<br />
Like to bubbles when rain pelteth;<br />
Then let winged Fancy wander<br />
Through the thought still spread beyond her:<br />
Open wide the mind’s cage-door,<br />
She’ll dart forth, and cloudward soar.<br />
O sweet Fancy! let her loose;<br />
Summer’s joys are spoilt by use,<br />
And the enjoying of the Spring<br />
Fades as does its blossoming;<br />
Autumn’s red-lipp’d fruitage too,<br />
Blushing through the mist and dew,<br />
Cloys with tasting: What do then?<br />
Sit thee by the ingle, when<br />
The sear faggot blazes bright,<br />
Spirit of a winter’s night;<br />
When the soundless earth is muffled,<br />
And the caked snow is shuffled<br />
From the ploughboy’s heavy shoon;<br />
When the Night doth meet the Noon<br />
In a dark conspiracy<br />
To banish Even from her sky.<br />
Sit thee there, and send abroad,<br />
With a mind self-overaw’d,<br />
Fancy, high-commission’d:—send her!<br />
She has vassals to attend her…<br />
