# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, 2019 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Small project Shakespeare's thoughts implementing bootstrap typography classes

**Thoughts:** Day 1 progress is small but I'm satisfied as I'm learning even if it is too little

### Day 2: July 2, 2019 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Small project implementing Keat's poem to understand bootstrap text alignments

**Thoughts**: It is quiet late but I made my mind to take out one hour no matter what. Quickly finished my peding tasks from office and here I am at the brink of end of the day to write my comments and update my progress. Taking baby steps towards learning bootstrap.
